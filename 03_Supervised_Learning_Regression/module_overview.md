# 03 Supervised Learning Regression Overview

This module introduces supervised learning with a focus on regression tasks. You will learn the fundamentals of regression, implement simple and multiple linear regression models, and understand how to evaluate their performance.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`3.1_Intro_Regression.py`**: An introduction to the concept of regression in supervised learning.
-   **`3.2_Simple_Linear_Regression.py`**: Implementing and understanding simple linear regression (one independent variable).
-   **`3.3_Multiple_Linear_Regression.py`**: Extending to multiple linear regression (multiple independent variables).
-   **`3.4_Regression_Evaluation.py`**: Learning about metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models (e.g., R-squared, MSE).

## Learning Path:

1.  Start with `3.1_Intro_Regression.py` to grasp the basics of regression.
2.  Move to `3.2_Simple_Linear_Regression.py` to build and understand your first regression model.
3.  Then, explore `3.3_Multiple_Linear_Regression.py` to handle more complex scenarios with multiple input features.
4.  Conclude with `3.4_Regression_Evaluation.py` to learn how to assess the quality of your regression models.
