# 02 Data Preprocessing Exploration Overview

This module focuses on the critical steps of data preprocessing and exploration. You'll learn how to load and explore datasets, handle common issues like missing data and categorical variables, scale features for model compatibility, and split your data for training and testing.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`2.1_Loading_Exploring_Data.py`**: Techniques for loading datasets and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-   **`2.2_Handling_Missing_Data.py`**: Strategies for identifying and imputing missing values in your dataset.
-   **`2.3_Encoding_Categorical_Data.py`**: Methods for converting categorical data (text-based) into numerical format suitable for ML models.
-   **`2.4_Feature_Scaling.py`**: Understanding the importance of feature scaling and implementing techniques like standardization and normalization.
-   **`2.5_Splitting_Data.py`**: How to split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Learning Path:

1.  Begin with `2.1_Loading_Exploring_Data.py` to understand how to load and get familiar with your data.
2.  Proceed to `2.2_Handling_Missing_Data.py` to learn about dealing with incomplete data.
3.  Next, `2.3_Encoding_Categorical_Data.py` will teach you how to handle non-numeric features.
4.  Follow with `2.4_Feature_Scaling.py` to learn about scaling your data appropriately.
5.  Finally, `2.5_Splitting_Data.py` will show you how to prepare your data for model training and evaluation.
