# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data like images. They are particularly effective for computer vision tasks.

## Why CNNs for Images?

### Traditional Neural Network Limitations
- High number of parameters
- Loss of spatial information
- Computationally expensive
- Poor feature extraction

### CNN Advantages
- Parameter sharing
- Spatial hierarchy preservation
- Translation invariance
- Efficient feature extraction

## CNN Architecture

### 1. Convolutional Layers
- **Filters/Kernels**: Small matrices that slide across the image
- **Feature Maps**: Output of convolution operation
- **Stride**: Step size of filter movement
- **Padding**: Handling image boundaries

### 2. Pooling Layers
- **Max Pooling**: Takes maximum value in window
- **Average Pooling**: Takes average value in window
- **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction
- **Benefits**: Translation invariance, reduced parameters

### 3. Fully Connected Layers
- Final classification layers
- Connect all neurons
- Output predictions
- Similar to traditional neural networks

## Key Concepts
