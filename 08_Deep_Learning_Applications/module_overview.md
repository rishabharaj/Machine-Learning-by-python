# 08 Deep Learning Applications Overview

This module explores specific applications of deep learning. You will be introduced to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), commonly used for image processing tasks, and work on a digit recognition mini-project. You will also get an introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are suitable for sequential data.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`8.1_Intro_CNNs.md`**: An introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and their architecture.
-   **`8.2_Mini_Project_Digit_Recognition.py`**: A hands-on project applying CNNs to recognize handwritten digits.
-   **`8.3_Intro_RNNs_LSTMs.md`**: An introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs for processing sequential data like text or time series.

## Learning Path:

1.  Start with `8.1_Intro_CNNs.md` to understand the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks.
2.  Apply your knowledge by working through the `8.2_Mini_Project_Digit_Recognition.py`.
3.  Then, explore `8.3_Intro_RNNs_LSTMs.md` to learn about networks designed for sequential data.
