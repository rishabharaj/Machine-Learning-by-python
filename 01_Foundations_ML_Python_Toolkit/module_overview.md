# 01 Foundations ML Python Toolkit Overview

This module introduces the foundational concepts of Machine Learning and AI, guides you through setting up your Python environment, and provides an introduction to essential Python libraries for ML: NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization. It also covers initial steps in understanding your data.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`1.1_What_is_ML_AI.md`**: Understanding Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
-   **`1.2_Setting_Up_Environment.md`**: Instructions for setting up the necessary software and environment.
-   **`1.3_Intro_NumPy.py`**: Introduction to NumPy for numerical computing.
-   **`1.4_Intro_Pandas.py`**: Introduction to Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.
-   **`1.5_Intro_Data_Visualization.py`**: Basics of data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
-   **`1.6_Understanding_Data.py`**: Initial steps in loading and understanding datasets.

## Learning Path:

1.  Start with `1.1_What_is_ML_AI.md` to get a conceptual understanding.
2.  Follow `1.2_Setting_Up_Environment.md` to prepare your workspace.
3.  Work through the Python files (`1.3` to `1.6`) to get hands-on experience with the core libraries and basic data handling.
