# 05 Model Evaluation Selection Overview

This module focuses on the crucial aspects of evaluating and selecting machine learning models. You will learn about the bias-variance tradeoff, techniques like cross-validation for robust model assessment, and methods for tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance. The module culminates in putting all these concepts together.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`5.1_Bias_Variance_Tradeoff.md`**: Understanding the fundamental concepts of bias and variance and their impact on model performance.
-   **`5.2_Cross_Validation.py`**: Learning about cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold CV) to get a more reliable estimate of model performance.
-   **`5.3_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py`**: Exploring methods like Grid Search and Random Search for finding the optimal hyperparameters for your models.
-   **`5.4_Putting_It_All_Together.py`**: A practical guide or example showing how to integrate model evaluation and selection techniques in a typical ML workflow.

## Learning Path:

1.  Begin with `5.1_Bias_Variance_Tradeoff.md` to understand this core concept in model performance.
2.  Proceed to `5.2_Cross_Validation.py` to learn how to evaluate models more robustly.
3.  Next, study `5.3_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py` to understand how to optimize your models.
4.  Finally, `5.4_Putting_It_All_Together.py` will help you consolidate your understanding of the model evaluation and selection process.
