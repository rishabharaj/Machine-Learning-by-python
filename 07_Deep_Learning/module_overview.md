# 07 Deep Learning Overview

This module provides an introduction to Deep Learning, a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. You will learn about the basic building blocks of neural networks, the concepts of gradient descent and backpropagation, and get an introduction to popular deep learning frameworks. You'll also build a simple neural network.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`7.1_What_Are_Neural_Networks.md`**: Understanding the fundamental concepts behind artificial neural networks.
-   **`7.2_Gradient_Descent_Backpropagation.md`**: Learning about the core algorithms used to train neural networks.
-   **`7.3_Intro_Deep_Learning_Frameworks.md`**: An overview of popular libraries and frameworks for deep learning (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch).
-   **`7.4_Building_Simple_NN.py`**: A practical exercise in constructing and training a basic neural network.

## Learning Path:

1.  Begin with `7.1_What_Are_Neural_Networks.md` to grasp the foundational ideas of neural networks.
2.  Study `7.2_Gradient_Descent_Backpropagation.md` to understand how these networks learn.
3.  Read `7.3_Intro_Deep_Learning_Frameworks.md` to get acquainted with the tools you'll use.
4.  Finally, work through `7.4_Building_Simple_NN.py` to get hands-on experience building your first neural network.
