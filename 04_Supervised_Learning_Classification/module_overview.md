# 04 Supervised Learning Classification Overview

This module delves into supervised learning for classification tasks. You will be introduced to various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and tree-based methods like Decision Trees and Random Forests. You'll also learn how to evaluate classification models and work on a mini-project.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`4.1_Intro_Classification.py`**: An introduction to classification problems in supervised learning.
-   **`4.2_Logistic_Regression.py`**: Understanding and implementing Logistic Regression for binary classification.
-   **`4.3_K_Nearest_Neighbors.py`**: Learning about the KNN algorithm and its application.
-   **`4.4_Support_Vector_Machines.py`**: Introduction to SVMs for classification.
-   **`4.5_Decision_Trees_Random_Forests.py`**: Exploring Decision Tree classifiers and the ensemble method of Random Forests.
-   **`4.6_Classification_Evaluation.py`**: Metrics for evaluating classification model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).
-   **`4.7_Mini_Project_Spam_Detection.py`**: Applying classification techniques to a practical problem of spam detection.

## Learning Path:

1.  Start with `4.1_Intro_Classification.py` to understand what classification is.
2.  Work through the different algorithm files (`4.2` to `4.5`) to learn about each classification technique.
3.  Study `4.6_Classification_Evaluation.py` to understand how to measure the performance of your classifiers.
4.  Finally, apply your knowledge by working on the `4.7_Mini_Project_Spam_Detection.py`.
