# Machine Learning by Python

This repository contains a structured collection of Python scripts and Markdown files designed to help you learn Machine Learning concepts from the ground up using Python.

## Repository Overview

This learning path is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific area of Machine Learning. Each module contains explanatory Markdown files and Python scripts with practical examples.

## Modules

The course is structured into the following modules:

| Module Number | Module Name                               | Description                                                                                                |

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rishabharaj/Machine-Learning-by-python.git
    cd Machine-Learning-by-python
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a module:** Each module is a directory (e.g., `01_Foundations_ML_Python_Toolkit`).
3.  **Start with the `module_overview.md`:** This file will guide you through the topics and files within that module.
4.  **Read the Markdown files (`.md`)** for conceptual explanations.
5.  **Run the Python scripts (`.py`)** to see practical implementations and examples. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

## Prerequisites

-   **Python:** Most scripts are written in Python 3.x.
-   **Python Libraries:**
    -   NumPy
    -   Pandas
    -   Matplotlib
    -   Seaborn
    -   Scikit-learn
    -   TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (for Deep Learning modules)

    It is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install these libraries. You can typically install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
    ```
    Refer to `01_Foundations_ML_Python_Toolkit/1.2_Setting_Up_Environment.md` for more detailed setup instructions.
