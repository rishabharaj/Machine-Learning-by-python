# üìò Machine Learning by Python

Welcome to the **Machine Learning by Python** repository ‚Äî a comprehensive, hands-on learning path to master Machine Learning (ML) using Python. Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your ML fundamentals, this repository provides structured modules with clear explanations and practical code examples.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This repository is organized into multiple **modules**, each focusing on a core area of Machine Learning. Each module includes:

- üìÑ Markdown (`.md`) files for conceptual understanding  
- üêç Python (`.py`) scripts for hands-on practice and implementation

## üß≠ Learning Path & Modules

The course is broken down into the following modules:

| Module | Title                                | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01     | Foundations & ML Python Toolkit      | Basics of ML/AI, Python environment setup, and essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.     |
| 02     | Data Preprocessing & Exploration     | Loading, exploring, cleaning, and preparing datasets for ML modeling.                                       |
| 03     | Supervised Learning: Regression      | Understanding and applying regression techniques like Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.                |
| 04     | Supervised Learning: Classification  | Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.|
| 05     | Model Evaluation & Selection         | Model evaluation metrics, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and bias-variance tradeoff.              |
| 06     | Unsupervised Learning                | Core concepts of unsupervised learning including Clustering (K-Means) and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).   |
| 07     | Deep Learning Basics                 | Neural networks, forward/backpropagation, gradient descent, and intro to DL frameworks.                     |
| 08     | Deep Learning Applications           | Real-world use cases like CNNs for image classification and RNNs/LSTMs for sequence data.                   |
| 09     | Next Steps & Further Learning        | Summary of key concepts and curated resources for advancing your ML/AI journey.                             |

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Essential Libraries:**
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` and/or `keras` or `torch` (for deep learning modules)

üí° It‚Äôs best to use a virtual environment:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```
