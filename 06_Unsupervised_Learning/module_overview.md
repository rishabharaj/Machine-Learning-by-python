# 06 Unsupervised Learning Overview

This module introduces unsupervised learning, where models learn patterns from unlabeled data. You will explore K-Means clustering for grouping similar data points and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. An application example will help solidify these concepts.

## Key Topics and Files:

-   **`6.1_Intro_Unsupervised_Learning.md` / `6.1_Intro_Unsupervised_Learning.py`**: An introduction to the concepts and goals of unsupervised learning.
-   **`6.2_K_Means_Clustering.py`**: Implementing and understanding the K-Means clustering algorithm.
-   **`6.3_Dimensionality_Reduction_PCA.py`**: Learning about PCA as a technique for reducing the number of features while preserving important information.
-   **`6.4_Application_Example.py`**: A practical example showcasing the application of unsupervised learning techniques.

## Learning Path:

1.  Start with `6.1_Intro_Unsupervised_Learning.md` (and the accompanying `.py` file if it provides code examples) to understand the fundamentals of unsupervised learning.
2.  Explore `6.2_K_Means_Clustering.py` to learn about one of the most popular clustering algorithms.
3.  Proceed to `6.3_Dimensionality_Reduction_PCA.py` to understand how to reduce data complexity.
4.  Finally, work through `6.4_Application_Example.py` to see unsupervised learning in action.
